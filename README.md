# FlashyVocab
FlashyVocab is a vocabulary learning application built using Python and Tkinter. It presents users with flashcards containing French words and their English translations. Users can flip the cards to reveal the translation, mark their knowledge level, and progress through the vocabulary list. 
# What I have learned
Throughout this project, I have gained experience and proficiency in working with the Tkinter library to develop graphical user interfaces in Python. Additionally, I have learned how to use the pandas library to read, manipulate, and convert data into DataFrames and dictionaries. I have implemented random selection of data using the random module and utilized the canvas widget to create visually appealing interfaces with images and text. Configuring and styling the canvas, handling user interactions through button clicks, and executing appropriate functions have also been a part of this project. Furthermore, I have created a flip card mechanism to display different content on the canvas and successfully saved and updated data in CSV files using pandas DataFrames. Managing program flow and timing of actions using global variables and timers, as well as understanding dependency management and organizing project files effectively, have been essential skills acquired throughout this project.
